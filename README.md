# logo-generator

In this app we have created a command line that accepts user input. in that command line the user should enter node index.js and that will bring up a line that
will allow you to enter up to three characters. The next question will prompt you for a color of that text. Then you have a choice of a triangle,circle or square of which you can enter a color (OR a hexadecimal number) for when it is prompted for each shape. After that an SVG file will be created. Then it can be opened in the folder files and accessed. There it will show the shape with a color for the shape a color for text and the 3 character text in the shape.
